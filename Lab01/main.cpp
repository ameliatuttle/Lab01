 * 1. Name:
 *      Amelia Tuttle
 * 2. Assignment Name:
 *      Lab 01: Hello World
 * 3. Assignment Description:
 *      A simple program to display a message on the screen
 * 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
 *      The hardest part of this assignment was installing xcode and learning the new IDE. I
 *      have used it before in in a class I took on C, but I uninstalled it because I thought I wouldn't
 *      need it again (lesson learned). I never got very used to it, but I'm excited to try again and get
 *      more familiar with the space. I have also never coded in C++ so that will be a bit of a challlenge.
 * 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
 *       1 hour
